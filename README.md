## Inspiration
Our inspiration is to build an infrastructure that help African Merchants to be able to receive payments from their customers regardless of where they are.

It has been extremely hard for customers to pay for goods from or to merchants in different African countries like Ghana, Togo, Benin etc.

There is huge gap of financial inclusion in African countries.

## What it does
xPay issue customers and merchants virtual wallets in different currencies which powered by **Seerbir,** the wallets are fundable via local bank transfer, USSD, or ATM Cards that accepted on **Seerbit** payment infrastructure. i.e Users in Nigeria can open a local bank account in Ghana and receive payments from users in Ghana, from the comfort of their homes.

Merchants can also create Invoices in customers name, the customer will receive the Invoice in their respective email address and pay the merchants using their local currency. 

With existence of mass number of unbanked people in Africa, xPay attempt to solve that under its Agency Network that enable account to be created in their names by our Agents and their Phone number serve as their account number which easier to be recognized, with no need to undergo a rigorous process.

The phone number will be used for Funding and Withdrawal from the user's account. Anywhere in Africa.

## How we built it
- Used Seerbit's API to power all the services, both virtual accounts, invoicing, and payments.

## Challenges we ran into
- Lack of electricity it lowered our productivity
- Not able to understand how to identify payment for an invoice via webhook notification

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are proud that we built a platform that truly transform cross-border payment within African countries 

## What we learned
We've learned a lot in African Payment ecosystem and Seerbit solution to allow payments across Africa
